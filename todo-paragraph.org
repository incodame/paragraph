* left to implement
** application_jar and want_opt: use tabling
without Options, one is asked to enter Options twice or more,
because of the redo after the failed
paragraph:contloc_app_archive(_16864, ear, 'paragraph-ui', _16454, _17192, [], [])
** application_jar, application_java_class
 - produce an ear file from the ParagraphUI war
 - implement methods for ear archives
 - fix showdoc
** download_as
use workdirectory
prevent use of other directory not under workdirectory
** paramval
*** force the use of structured term e.g. earfile(E) for container
*** solution for removing large number of predicates (and choicepoints) 
 - new paramv uses constrained search in graph, and foldl
 - find solution for replacing setup_call_cleanup in foldl: use undo/1 from swipl 8.3.24
*** file transformation: example with jq
*** complete example: maven_checks.pl
*** chaining tests
** verticles
 - first implementation of Pwsh and Query verticles
 - use docker postgres image
** scratch introduction
* improve
** contloc_app_archive 
processes files . and ..
it uses directory_files and could filter based on the FileType if it is ground
tabling not yet working
** use yaml paragraph configuration
 - finish implementation for app files and archives
 - directory aliases in separate yaml
** example of integration with ansible
 - using the python pengine client
* done
