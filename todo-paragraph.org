* left to implement 
** application_jar and want_opt: use tabling
without Options, one is asked to enter Options twice or more,
because of the redo after the failed
paragraph:contloc_app_archive(_16864, ear, 'paragraph-ui', _16454, _17192, [], [])
** application_java_class
produce an ear file from the ParagraphUI war
** download_as
use workdirectory
prevent use of other directory not under workdirectory
** paramval
*** force the use of structured term e.g. earfile(E) for container
*** solution for removing large number of predicates (choicepoints) 
 - using graph
*** use tabling for recursive calls of paramval
*** complete example: maven_checks.pl
** TODO create docker image for paragraph
* improve
** contloc_app_archive 
processes files . and ..
it uses directory_files and could filter based on the FileType if it is ground
tabling not yet working
